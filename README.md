# MuJoCo Models

This is a repository of MuJoCo-compatible models for remote download in K-Scale projects

Current MJCFs:
- Stompy legs + full-body
- Default humanoid (an easier task for PPO models)

There may be some additoinal changes necessary for rendering (adding cameras "side/front") and collisions (altering `visualgeom` classes)
